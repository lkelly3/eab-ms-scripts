Custom Perl scripts from Kelly et al., Convergent Molecular Evolution Among Ash Species Resistant to the Emerald Ash Borer. doi.org/10.1101/772913.

Instructions for usage, including details of the required input files, are provided as comments within each of the scripts.

PLEASE NOTE: Whilst these scripts perform as described on the input files we have tested, they may fail or produce incorrect output if the input file format deviates in any way from that expected by the script. Any users should assure themselves that the output generated with their own input files is as intended.
